summary: This blueprint provides a common module in an Inbound Message Flow that uses  identifying information like an email address, phone number, etc. and attempt to find an external contact that owns the identity and merge the conversation with that existing record to establish a single customer view.
---

Ephemeral messaging conversations are not currently automatically identified to an existing external contact, which means when they arrive at the Agent they are typically unknown with no customer journey data available. This blueprint provides a common module in an Inbound Message Flow that accepts participant data for identifying information like an email address, phone number, etc. and attempt to find an external contact that owns the identity and merge the conversation with that existing record to establish a single customer view.

## Preparation Steps

### Clone the Repository

Clone the blueprint repository [merge-ephemeral-message-to-external-contact-blueprint](https://github.com/GenesysCloudBlueprints/merge-ephemeral-message-to-external-contact-blueprint "Goes to the merge-ephemeral-message-to-external-contact-blueprint repository") to your local machine. You can also run this git command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GenesysCloudBlueprints/merge-ephemeral-message-to-external-contact-blueprint.git
```

### Create an OAuth Client

In Genesys Cloud Admin, go to **Integrations** > **OAuth**. Then, click **Add Client**.

![OAuth Page](images/ephemeral-external-contact-01.png "OAuth Page")

Provide the **Name**, **Description**, and **Token Duration**. Select the `Client Credentials` **Grant Type**. This will ask you to select role/s for this client, which you can select on the **Roles** tab. Once you have assigned a role and provided the details, click **Save**.

![OAuth Form](images/ephemeral-external-contact-02.png "OAuth Form")
![Roles Tab](images/ephemeral-external-contact-03.png "Roles Tab")

You can then see the Client ID and Client Secret that you will use later.

![OAuth Details](images/ephemeral-external-contact-04.png "OAuth Details")

## Manual Implementation via Genesys Cloud

### Add Genesys Cloud Data Action Integration

Add a Genesys Cloud data action integration for each OAuth client being used with this blueprint to call the Genesys Cloud Public API to:

- Fetch External Contact By Identifier
- Get External Contact Id For Customer Participant
- Merge External Contacts

:::primary
You can also use your existing Genesys Cloud Data Action Integration in order to implement this blueprint.
:::

To create a data action integration in Genesys Cloud:

1. Navigate to **Admin** > **Integrations** > **Integrations** and install the **Genesys Cloud Data Actions** integration. For more information, see [About the data actions integrations](https://help.mypurecloud.com/?p=209478 "Opens the About the data actions integrations article") in the Genesys Cloud Resource Center.

2. Enter a name for the Genesys Cloud Data Action, such as **Merge Ephemeral Message to External Contact** in this blueprint solution.

3. On the **Configuration** tab, click **Credentials** and then click **Configure**.

4. Enter the [client ID and client secret that you created](#create-an-oauth-client "Goes to the Create an OAuth Client section"). Click **OK** and save the data action.

5. Navigate to the Integrations page and set the data action integration to **Active**.

![Data Action Integration Details](images/ephemeral-external-contact-05.png "Data Action Integration Details")

### Import the Data Actions

All Data Actions to import (that are in JSON files) are in the `/exports` folder in the [blueprint repository](#clone-the-repository "Goes to the Clone the Repository section") namely:

- `FetchExternalContactByIdentifierDataAction.json`
- `GetExternalContactIdForCustomerParticipantV2DataAction.json`
- `MergeExternalContactsDataAction.json`

You can import these data actions using the following steps:

1. In Genesys Cloud, navigate to **Admin** > **Integrations** > **Actions** and click **Import**.
2. Select the json files and associate with **Merge Ephemeral Message to External Contact** data action integration.
3. Click **Import Action**.
4. Click **Save & Publish**

![Imported Data Actions](images/ephemeral-external-contact-06.png "Imported Data Actions")

### Import the Architect Flows

There are three additional files in the `/exports` folder in the [blueprint repository](#clone-the-repository "Goes to the Clone the Repository section") that contains the flows needed:

1. `ResolveContact.i3CommonModuleFlow` - the common module that utilizes the data actions provided. Given the participant data (ie. email, phone number, social media details, etc.), it calls the `Fetch External Contact By Identifier` data action to fetch an external contact given the provided participant data. It then calls the `Get External Contact Id For Customer Participant` data action to fetch the contact IDs in the current conversation. The module then checks against the ID from the external contact and the ID from the conversation. If it didn't match, the conversation will be merged to the external contact with the `Merge External Contacts` data action.

2. `MergeExternalContactBot.i3BotFlow` - the bot flow that asks for the participant's email. For demonstration purposes, we will be asking the participant's email to retrieve participant data. You may modify the bot flow to accept other participant data like mobile number, social media name, etc.

3. `MergeExternalContactMessageFlow.i3InboundMessage`- the inbound message flow that utilizes both the bot flow and common module. It starts with the bot flow that asks for the participant's email and then proceeds to the common module. Once, completed, it then routes the flow to a queue.

#### Import the Common Module

1. In Genesys Cloud, navigate to **Admin** > **Architect** > **Flows:Common Module** and click **Add**.

2. Enter a name for the inbound message flow and click **Create Flow**.

3. From the **Save** menu, click **Import**.

4. Select the `ResolveContact.i3CommonModuleFlow` file from `/exports` and click **Import**.

5. Ensure that the data actions are connected to the correct integration and data action. You may change these to point to the correct one when there is an error detected.

6. Click **Save** and then click **Publish**.

![Resolve Contact Common Module](images/ephemeral-external-contact-07.png "Resolve Contact Common Module")

#### Import the Bot Flow

1. In Genesys Cloud, navigate to **Admin** > **Architect** > **Flows:Bot Flow** and click **Add**.

2. Enter a name for the inbound message flow and click **Create Flow**.

3. From the **Save** menu, click **Import**.

4. Select the `MergeExternalContactBot.i3BotFlow` file from `/exports` and click **Import**.

5. Click **Save** and then click **Publish**.

![Merge External Contact Bot](images/ephemeral-external-contact-08.png "Merge External Contact Bot")

#### Import the Inbound Message Flow

1. In Genesys Cloud, navigate to **Admin** > **Architect** > **Flows:Inbound Message Flow** and click **Add**.

2. Enter a name for the inbound message flow and click **Create Flow**.

3. From the **Save** menu, click **Import**.

4. Select the `MergeExternalContactMessageFlow.i3InboundMessage` file from `/exports` and click **Import**.

5. Click the `Transfer to ACD` step and select a queue to accept the Inbound Message interaction.

6. Click **Save** and then click **Publish**.

:::primary
**Note**: Ensure that the `Call Bot Flow` and `Call Common Module` step is connected to the correct bot flow and common module.
:::

## CX as Code

### Setup environment variables

In the root directory of the repository, set the following environment variables in a terminal window before you run this project using the Terraform provider:

- `GENESYSCLOUD_OAUTHCLIENT_ID` - This variable is the Genesys Cloud client credential grant Id that CX as Code executes against.
- `GENESYSCLOUD_OAUTHCLIENT_SECRET` - This variable is the Genesys Cloud client credential secret that CX as Code executes against.
- `GENESYSCLOUD_REGION` - This variable is the Genesys Cloud region in your organization.

:::primary
You can also use the [client ID and client secret that you created](#create-an-oauth-client "Goes to the Create an OAuth Client section").
:::

### Configure the Terraform build

In the root directory of the repository, open `dev.auto.tfvars` file, where you need to set the following:

- `email` - The email of the account that will be used to assigned to the given Genesys Cloud queue.
- `division` - The division name where the Genesys Cloud objects will be created.
- `bot_flow_name` - name to be assigned to the bot flow.
- `common_module_name`- name to be assigned to the common module.
- `queue_name` - name of the queue to be created that will be assigned to the inbound message flow.
- `web_deployment_configuration_name` - name to be assigned to the web message configuration.
- `web_deployment_name` - name to be assigned to the web message deployment.
- `client_id` - value of your OAuth Client ID using Client Credentials to be used for the data action integration.
- `client_secret` - value of your OAuth Client secret using Client Credentials to be used for the data action integration.

Do replace the `email`, `division`, `client_id`, and `client_secret`. The file already provided names for the Genesys Cloud objects, which you can also modify.

:::primary
**Important**: Do not commit a change in the `.tfvars` file that involves saving sensitive information.
:::

### Run Terraform

The blueprint solution is now ready for your organization to use.

To run, issue the following commands:

- `terraform init` - This command initializes a working directory containing Terraform configuration files.  
- `terraform plan` - This command executes a trial run against your Genesys Cloud organization and displays a list of all the Genesys Cloud resources Terraform created. Review this list and make sure that you are comfortable with the plan before you continue to the next step.
- `terraform apply --auto-approve` - This command creates and deploys the necessary objects in your Genesys Cloud account. The `--auto-approve` flag provides the required approval before the command creates the objects.

After the `terraform apply --auto-approve` command successfully completes, you can see the output of the command's entire run along with the number of objects that Terraform successfully created. Keep the following points in mind:

- This project assumes that you run this blueprint solution with a local Terraform backing state, which means that the `tfstate` files are created in the same folder where you run the project. Terraform recommends that you use local Terraform backing state files **only** if you run from a desktop or are comfortable deleting files.

- As long as you keep your local Terraform backing state projects, you can tear down this blueprint solution. To tear down the solution, change to the `docs/terraform` folder and issue the  `terraform destroy --auto-approve` command. This command destroys all objects that the local Terraform backing state currently manages.

## Deployment and Testing

### Deploy the messaging snippet to your website

1. In the Genesys Cloud, navigate to **Admin** > **Message** > **Messenger Deployments**. Select your Messenger Deployment.
2. Under **Deploy your snippet**, click **Copy to Clipboard** to copy the snippet. Paste the snippet in the `<head>` tag of the web pages where you want the Messenger to appear.
